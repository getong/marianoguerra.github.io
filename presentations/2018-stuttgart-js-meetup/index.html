# Let's Recap

class: center, middle

# &lt; 1944

Computer was a Job Title

---

class: middle

---

# 1939 - Z1 Konrad Zuse

World's first binary digital computer

---

# 1944 - Mark I (3,500 relays)

# 1944 - Colossus (2,500 vacuum tubes)

---

class: center, middle

![mark I](imgs/js-mark-I.jpg)

Programs were physical, "programmed with wires"

---

# 1945 - Von Neumann architecture

Outlines the architecture of a stored-program computer

including electronic storage of programming information and data

which eliminates the need for more clumsy methods of programming such as
plugboards, punched cards and paper

--

Like a Virtual ... Machine

# 1946 - ENIAC  (18000 vacum tubes)

Panel-to-panel wiring and switches for programming

---

# 1949 - EDSAC

One major advance in programming was Wilkes' use of a **library** of short
programs, called **subroutines**,
stored on punched paper tapes and used for performing common repetitive
calculations within a lager program.

---

# 1952 - Grace Hopper completes A-0

A program that allows a computer user to use English-like words instead of
numbers to give the computer instructions.

---

# 1956 - Keyboard Input

Typically, computer users of the time fed their programs into a computer using
punched cards or paper tape

---

# 1957 - Fortran (FORmula TRANslator)

John Backus develops FORTRAN, a powerful scientific computing language that
uses English-like statements.

Some programmers were skeptical that FORTRAN could be as efficient as hand
coding.

If, Loops, Variables, Comments

---

# 1958 - LISP (LISt Processing)

Homoiconicity

---

# 1960 - COBOL

Common Business-Oriented Language

Readability

---

# 1962 - APL

Kenneth Iverson’s book A Programming Language details a form of mathematical
notation that he had developed in the late 1950s.

IBM hired Iverson and it was there that APL evolved into a practical
programming language.

```
life←{↑1 ω∨.∧3 4=+/,¯1 0 1∘.⊖¯1 0 1∘.⌽⊂ω}
```

# 1963 - Sketchpad

Ivan Sutherland publishes Sketchpad, an **interactive**, **real-time** computer
drawing system, as his MIT doctoral thesis.

Using a light pen and Sketchpad, a designer could draw and manipulate
geometric figures on a computer screen

# 1964 - BASIC

Thomas Kurtz and John Kemeny create BASIC

Beginner’s All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code

---

# 1965 - Simula

OOP

---

# 1967 - LOGO

Learnability, Exploration

---

# 1968 - The Mother of All Demos

For ninety minutes, the stunned audience of around a thousand witnesses
**collaborative editing**, **videoconferencing**, **word processing**, and a strange
pointing device jokingly referred to as a "**mouse**".

Every paragraph or other element in the NLS system can be linked to other
elements using **hypertext links**.

# 1969 - Unix
# 1970 - Scheme
# 1971 - First Microprocessor, Email
# 1972 - C

# 1972 - Dynabook

![dynabook](imgs/dynabook.png)

---

# 1974 - Alto, Smalltalk

It was based on a **graphical user interface** using **windows**, **icons**, and a **mouse**, and worked together with other Altos over a **local area network**.

It could also **share files** and print out documents on an advanced Xerox **laser printer**.

Applications were also highly innovative: a **WYSISYG word processor** known as “Bravo,” a paint program, a graphics editor, and **email** for example.

# 1975: already have a computer and a language I can use to develop instadeq.

I only need a faster computer (color display would be nice)

# 1976 - Vi

**Vi**sual mode for ex, **ex**tended version of ed

sed: s/ed/

grep: g/re/p

# 1978 - VT-100

# 1978

I have my unix, editor, makefiles and my terminal

---

# 1979 - Visicalc

# 1987 - Hypercard, Self, Perl

---

# 1990 - WWW

It features a server, HTML, URLs, and the first browser.

That browser **also functions as an editor—like a word processor connected to
the Internet** – which reflects his original vision that the Web also
incorporate authoring and personal organization tools.

---

# 1991

Viola and Midas are initially the most popular, eclipsed later by Mosaic.

**All of them leave out editing features, which are trickier to implement** on
machines other than the NeXT.

---

# 1993 - Mosaic
# 1994 - Netscape
# 1995 - Java 1.0, Javascript!
# 1999 - Ecmascript 3

---

# 2017 - I give the talk "Tools, Why and When"

```
$ create-react-app hello-world
$ du -sh node_modules
128M    node_modules // 2018: 189M
$ ls -1 node_modules | wc -l

# after eject

```
wc -l config/*.js config/**/*.js

311GB node_modules in 2038

---

![mods-size](imgs/science-mods.png)

9116 dependencies in 2038

# 2017: Project depends on

React.DOM and ReactDOM.render

rm cp mv cat wget

cssmin requirejs*

make

5 vendored dependencies (react, immutable, voca, echarts, bootstrap)

---

# 2018 - Instadeq 1.0

React.DOM and ReactDOM.render

rm cp mv cat wget

tar sed // bloat!

cssmin requirejs*

make

7 vendored dependencies (react, immutable, voca, d3-dsv, dateformat, echarts, bootstrap)

# Time machine experiment

How much time would it take if we took someone from the netscape/js 1.0 era and
got it up to speed 20 years later

How much of the "up to speed" session would be accidental complexity

---

Accidental complexity relates to problems which engineers create and can fix

---

Essential complexity is caused by the problem to be solved, and nothing can
remove it

---

# Build me a CRUD app

---

# How are we going to be programming in 2038?

Someone from the future comes and takes you there and it's a browser,
javascript, some new text editor that consumes 200GB of RAM per text file,
makefiles reinvented for the 100th time and

**9116 dependencies and 311GB node_modules** for hello world

---

In the 70s you could go to PARC and play with the future.

Where do we go now to play with the future?
