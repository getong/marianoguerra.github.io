# Let's Recap

&lt; 1944 Computer was a Job Title

---

# 1939: Z1 Konrad Zuse

World's first binary digital computer

---

# 1944: Mark I (3,500 relays)

# 1944: Colossus (2,500 vacuum tubes)

---

class: center, middle

![mark I](imgs/js-mark-I.jpg)

Programs were physical, "programmed with wires"

---

# 1945: Von Neumann architecture

Outlines the architecture of a stored-program computer

including electronic storage of programming information and data

which eliminates the need for more clumsy methods of programming such as
plugboards, punched cards and paper

In 1928, Hollerith's company, now renamed IBM, introduced the rectangular hole 80 column format

![patch](imgs/patch.jpg)

---

# 1949: EDSAC

Used a **library** of short programs, called **subroutines**,
stored on punched paper tapes

---

# 1952: Grace Hopper completes A-0

First compiler

---

# 1956: Keyboard Input

Typically, computer users of the time fed their programs into a computer using
punched cards or paper tape

---

# 1957: Fortran (FORmula TRANslator)

John Backus develops FORTRAN, a powerful scientific computing language that
uses English-like statements.

Some programmers were skeptical that FORTRAN could be as efficient as hand
coding.

If, Loops, Variables, Comments

---

# 1958: LISP (LISt Processing)

* Tree data structures
* GC
* Dynamic typing
* Conditionals
* Higher-order functions
* Recursion
* Self-hosting compiler
* Read–Eval–Print Loop (REPL)

# 1960: COBOL

Common Business-Oriented Language

---

# 1962: APL

Kenneth Iverson’s book A Programming Language details a mathematical
notation.

IBM hired Iverson and APL evolved into a practical programming language.

```

# 1963: Sketchpad

Ivan Sutherland publishes Sketchpad, an **interactive**, **real-time** computer
drawing system, as his MIT doctoral thesis.

Using a light pen and Sketchpad, a designer could draw and manipulate
geometric figures on a computer screen

# 1964: BASIC

Beginner’s All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code

```
10 PRINT "HELLO WORLD!"
20 GOTO 10
```

---

# 1965: Simula

OOP

![mindstorms](imgs/mindstorms.jpg)

1967: Logo (from cables to kids in ~25 years)

---

# 1968: The Mother of All Demos

Douglas Engelbart presented **collaborative editing**, **videoconferencing**,
**word processing**, and a strange pointing device jokingly referred to as a
"**mouse**".

Every paragraph or other element in the NLS system can be linked to other
elements using **hypertext links**.

# 1970: Scheme
# 1971: First Microprocessor

# 1972: Dynabook

![dynabook](imgs/dynabook.png)

---

# 1974: Alto, Smalltalk

It was based on a **graphical user interface** using **windows**, **icons**, and a **mouse**, and worked together with other Altos over a **local area network**.

It could also **share files** and print out documents on an advanced Xerox **laser printer**.

Applications were also highly innovative: a **WYSISYG word processor** known as “Bravo,” a paint program, a graphics editor, and **email** for example.

Computer and language I can use to develop today

I only need a faster computer (color display would be nice)

# 1990: WWW

It features a server, HTML, URLs, and the first browser.

That browser **also functions as an editor—like a word processor connected to
the Internet** – which reflects his original vision that the Web also
incorporate authoring and personal organization tools.

---

# 1991

Viola and Midas are initially the most popular, eclipsed later by Mosaic.

**All of them leave out editing features, which are trickier to implement** on
machines other than the NeXT.

---

# 1993: Mosaic
# 1994: Netscape
# 1995: Java 1.0, Javascript!
# 1999: Ecmascript 3

# 2017: I give the talk "Tools, Why and When"

```
$ create-react-app hello-world
$ du -sh node_modules
128M    node_modules // 2018: 189M
$ ls -1 node_modules | wc -l

# after eject

```
wc -l config/*.js config/**/*.js

When google chrome launched in 2008 it had [1.7M LoC](https://www.openhub.net/p/chrome/analyses/latest/languages_summary)

VPRI wants to shrink all of computing to 30000 LoC

311GB node_modules in 2038

---

![mods-size](imgs/science-mods.png)

9116 dependencies in 2038

# 2017: Project depends on

React.DOM and ReactDOM.render

rm cp mv cat wget

cssmin requirejs

make

5 vendored dependencies (react, immutable, voca, echarts, bootstrap)

---

# 2018: Instadeq 1.0

React.DOM and ReactDOM.render

rm cp mv cat wget

tar sed // bloat!

requirejs uglifyjs

make

7 vendored dependencies (react, immutable, voca, d3-dsv, dateformat, echarts, bootstrap)

# Time machine experiment

How much time would it take if we took someone from the netscape/js 1.0 era and
got it up to speed 20 years later

How much of the "up to speed" session would be accidental complexity

---

# Accidental complexity

Relates to problems which engineers create and can fix

---

# Essential complexity

is caused by the problem to be solved, and nothing can
remove it

---

# How are we going to be programming in 2038?

Someone from the future comes and takes you there and it's a browser,
javascript, some new text editor that consumes 200GB of RAM per text file,
makefiles reinvented for the 100th time and

**9116 dependencies and 311GB node_modules** for hello world

In the 70s you could go to PARC and play with the future.

Where do we go now to play with the future?
