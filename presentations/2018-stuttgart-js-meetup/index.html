Arithmetic Language version 0

First compiler

# 1957: Fortran (FORmula TRANslator)

John Backus develops FORTRAN.

Some programmers were skeptical that FORTRAN could be as efficient as hand
coding.

If, Loops, Variables, Comments

---

# 1958: LISP (LISt Processing)

* Tree data structures
* GC
* Dynamic typing
* Conditionals
* Higher-order functions
* Recursion
* Self-hosting compiler
* Read–Eval–Print Loop (REPL)

# 1962: APL

Kenneth Iverson’s book A Programming Language details a mathematical
notation.

IBM hired Iverson and APL evolved into a practical programming language.

# 1963: Sketchpad

Ivan Sutherland publishes Sketchpad, an **interactive**, **real-time** computer
drawing system, as his MIT doctoral thesis.

Using a light pen and Sketchpad, a designer could draw and manipulate
geometric figures on a computer screen

# 1968: The Mother of All Demos

Douglas Engelbart presented **collaborative editing**, **videoconferencing**,
**word processing**, and a strange pointing device jokingly referred to as a
"**mouse**".

Every paragraph or other element in the NLS system can be linked to other
elements using **hypertext links**.

# 1974: Alto, Smalltalk

It was based on a **graphical user interface** using **windows**, **icons**, and a **mouse**, and worked together with other Altos over a **local area network**.

It could also **share files** and print out documents on an advanced Xerox **laser printer**.

Applications were also highly innovative: a **WYSISYG word processor** known as “Bravo,” a paint program, a graphics editor, and **email** for example.

# 1990: WWW

Server, HTML, URLs, and the first browser

That browser **also functions as an editor—like a word processor connected to
the Internet**

---

# 1991

Viola and Midas are initially the most popular, eclipsed later by Mosaic.

**All of them leave out editing features, which are trickier to implement** on
machines other than the NeXT.

# 1994: Netscape
# 1995: Java 1.0, Javascript!

# 2017: Project depends on

# 2018: Instadeq 1.0

ES whatever-ie-11-supports

React.DOM and ReactDOM.render

make rm cp mv cat wget

tar sed // bloat!

# Time machine experiment

How much time would it take if we took someone from the netscape/js 1.0 era and
got it up to speed 20 years later

How much of the "up to speed" session would be accidental complexity

---

# Accidental complexity

Relates to problems which engineers create and can fix

---

# Essential complexity

is caused by the problem to be solved, and nothing can
remove it

---

# How are we going to be programming in 2038?

Someone from the future comes and takes you there and it's a browser,
javascript, some new text editor that consumes 200GB of RAM per text file,
makefiles reinvented for the 100th time and

**9116 dependencies and 311GB node_modules** for hello world
