The first tells the ant that when it feels other ants walking on its back, it
should freeze. “As long as someone walks over you, you stay put,” Garnier said.

This same process repeats in the other ants: They step over the first ant, but
— uh-oh — the gap is still there, so the next ant in line slows, gets trampled
and freezes in place. In this way, the ants build a bridge long enough to span
whatever gap is in front of them. The trailing ants in the colony then walk
over it.

There’s more to it than that, though. Bridges involve trade-offs. Imagine a
colony of ants comes to a V-shaped gap in its path. The colony doesn’t want to
go all the way around the gap — that would take too long — but it also doesn’t
build a bridge across the widest part of the gap that would minimize how far
the colony has to travel. The fact that army ants don’t always build the
distance-minimizing bridge suggests there’s some other factor in their
unconscious calculation.

http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AntColonyAlgorithm.html

The ant colony algorithm is an algorithm for finding optimal paths that is
based on the behavior of ants searching for food.

At first, the ants wander randomly. When an ant finds a source of food, it
walks back to the colony leaving "markers" (pheromones) that show the path has
food. When other ants come across the markers, they are likely to follow the
path with a certain probability. If they do, they then populate the path with
their own markers as they bring the food back. As more ants find the path, it
gets stronger until there are a couple streams of ants traveling to various
food sources near the colony.

Because the ants drop pheromones every time they bring food, shorter paths are
more likely to be stronger, hence optimizing the "solution." In the meantime,
some ants are still randomly scouting for closer food sources. A similar
approach can be used find near-optimal solution to the traveling salesman
problem.

Once the food source is depleted, the route is no longer populated with
pheromones and slowly decays.

Because the ant-colony works on a very dynamic system, the ant colony algorithm
works very well in graphs with changing topologies. Examples of such systems
include computer networks, and artificial intelligence simulations of workers.

# Core Idea

Eventually but deterministically converging to the same shared view

Achieved by restricting operations to allow applying them in any order (commutativity)

Can gossip and scale more than consensus

Distant relatives that evolved under different constraints

DLT is a recent shared specimen since it accepts temporal divergence to scale
