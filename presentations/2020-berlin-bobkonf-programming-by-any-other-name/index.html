[Slides @ marianoguerra.github.io](https://marianoguerra.github.io)

???

Will go over many things fast, I want to cover all the possibilities, you can
later focus on the ones you like

y will read from slides because I'm a newbie on almost all of them and I don't
want to say things that are wrong so much :)

---

# Why

--

Can be as productive as anyone today with tools from the 70s (vim, bash, make, grep, unix)

--

With the right tools from the 70s/80s someone can be much more productive (Smalltalk, Lisp)

--

A Computer scientist to Create a CRUD app (with bugs)

--

VC funding to create a To Do app (with bugs)

--

Supercomputers on the table, no way to make them do something together

???

Not a "the grass was greener in the 70s" guy,
just a "the grass is greener somewhere today, let's go there"

---

# Hypernormalization

Everyone in the Soviet Union knew the system was failing

???

Let's break this local maxima and search for another higher ones

--

But no one could imagine an alternative to the status quo

--

Politicians and citizens were resigned to maintaining the pretense of a functioning society

--

Over time, this delusion became a self-fulfilling prophecy

--

The fakeness was accepted by everyone as real

---

You can see it in the past, if you went to the right places you could see
smalltalk and lisp in the 70s

# Chemical Computing

Encompassed the **definition of molecules, reaction
rules, and the topology and dynamics of the reaction space**.

This kind of chemical information processing is known to be **robust,
self-organizing, adaptive, decentralized, asynchronous, fault-tolerant, and
evolvable**.

Computation **emerges** out of an orchestrated interplay of **many decentralized
relatively simple components** (molecules).

---

# Amorphous Computing

Agents run asynchronously, are interconnected in unknown and possibly time-varying ways, communicate only locally, and are identically programmed.

If we suppose that each cell is a computing element whose program is encoded in
DNA, then an embryo would be a massively distributed system that runs a single
program on all its elements and produces a globally coherent result.

The study of amorphous computing seeks to identify and apply the engineering
principles behind the coordination of such a multitudinous distributed system.

???

An amorphous computing system is a large collection of irregularly placed, lo-
cally interacting, identically-programmed, asynchronous computing elements [1].
We assume that these elements (agents) communicate within a fixed radius, which
is large relative to the size of an element, but small relative to the diame-
ter of the system. We also assume that most agents do not initially have any
in- formation to distinguish themselves from other agents; this includes
information such as position, identity and connectivity. The challenge of
amorphous comput- ing is to develop computing paradigms that enable us to write
programs that when executed on each agent produce some pre-specified emergent
behaviour.

---

# Autonomic Computing

**Inspired by the human autonomic nervous system**. Its goal is to realize computer and software systems that can manage themselves in accordance with high-level guidance from humans.

A **homeostatic system** is an open system that maintains its structure and
functions by means of a **multiplicity of dynamic equilibriums** that are
rigorously controlled by **interdependent regulation mechanisms**.

---

# Autonomic Computing

Such a system reacts to every change in the environment, or to every random
disturbance, through a series of modifications that are equal in size and
opposite in direction to those that created the disturbance.

The goal of these modifications is to maintain internal balances.

???

An autonomic computing system requires:

(a) sensor channels to sense the changes in the internal and external environment, and

(b) motor channels to react to and counter the effects of the changes in the environment by changing the system and maintaining equilibrium.

The changes sensed by the sensor channels have to be analyzed to determine if
any of the essential variables has gone out of their viability limits.

If so, it has to trigger some kind of planning to determine what changes to
inject into the current behavior of the system such that it returns to the
equilibrium state within the new environment.

---

# Robust-first Computing

> Deterministic machines will crash, seize-up, or otherwise misbehave when virtually anything goes wrong inside them; living organisms, by contrast, can suffer grievous injury and yet survive, handle the immediate situation, and get away long enough to heal up and live on.

[Site](http://robust.cs.unm.edu/doku.php), [Resources](http://robust.cs.unm.edu/doku.php?id=introduction:where_can_i_get_more_information)

[T2 Tile Project](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1M91QuLZfCzHjBMEKvIc-A)

???

A system is robust if it tends to do something sensible even when it's design assumtions are under stress or violated

A lot of computer science is about using computer hardware efficiently

Efficiency and robustness are at odds over redundancy
* robustness requires
* efficiency eliminates

We should put robustness first and view maximizing efficiency not as an inherent virtue, but more as a regrettable sometimes necessity

The world has changed, hardware is much cheaper, more powerful than we need for a given task

And there are bugs everywhere

But we are still carrying the Correctness and Efficienty Only attitude

We should change the attitude and put robustness first and see what that would mean

- Movable Feast Machine (MFM)
    - Indefinite scalability
    - Inherent robustness
    - 2D grid of individual sites
        - Each site can hold dozens of bits or hundreds
        - Each site has processing power
        - Many things going on at once
        - Each site can be empty of have an atom
            - DReg: dynamic regulator
            - There's no global origin
            - From the POV of the given atom it is the center, everything is relative to the self (indexing), short ranged
            - Event window: the limit of number of sites that can be accessed by a given atom (4 in any direction, 41 total)
            - Can read and write to the event window arbitrarily when executing
            - MFM can be executing many events simultaneously as long of no event windows overlap
